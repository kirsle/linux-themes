# Linux Desktop Themes

These are some of my customized desktop themes for Linux. Some of them are ports
of themes from other operating systems, some are slightly modified themes made
by other people (to fix their mistakes in their themes, etc.)

Each theme is accompanied by a README file explaining its background, and a
screenshot of the theme.

There are xfwm4 themes for the Xfce desktop and metacity themes for the MATE
and Gnome 2 desktops.
